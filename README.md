# Purchase Prediction And MicroNumerosity 💰📈

This repository contains the code and resources for my internship project with the YBI Foundation of AI/ML, focused on Purchase Prediction and MicroNumerosity using Python and Jupyter Notebook. 🐍📔

## Project Overview

The project aimed to develop models and techniques for predicting customer purchase behavior and analyzing micronumerosity data. The following tasks were accomplished:

1. **Purchase Prediction**: Built machine learning models to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on various features and data. 🛒🔮

2. **MicroNumerosity**: Explored and analyzed micronumerosity data, which refers to the study of small or underrepresented groups within a larger population. 👥🔍

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter Notebook files with the code, analysis, and visualizations for the project. 📓
- `data/`: Directory for storing the datasets used in the project (not included in the repository due to size constraints or privacy concerns). 📊
- `models/`: Trained machine learning models (if applicable). 🤖
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages and dependencies required to run the code. 📋

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Piyu-Pika/Purchase_Prediction_And_MicroNumerosity.git` 📥
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt` ⚙️
3. Open the relevant Jupyter Notebook files in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the code, analysis, and visualizations. 🚀
